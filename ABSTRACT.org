* Abstract
  Functional programming is slowly but surely becoming the norm in
  industrial settings.  There are many advantages that make it a great
  choice as a programming discipline for industry. Functional
  programming is also a very deep and interesting field in its own
  right. For the student that is just getting started learning about
  computer science and in their career I hope to show:
  1. A few of functional programming's practical benefits
  2. How interesting some advanced and formal parts of functional
     programming research are
* After this talk, students should be able to:
  1. Understand there are many kinds of functional programming
  2. Understand a few benefits of untyped functional programming
  3. Know a few benefits of typed functional programming
  4. Know a few benefits of type systems and calculi
  5. Know where to find out more if they are interested
